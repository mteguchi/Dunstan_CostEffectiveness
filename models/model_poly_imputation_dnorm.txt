# JAGS model for imputing missing hatchling counts at Raine Island

# The known cyclical nature of hatching is modeled by 2nd order polynomial
# functions.  Hatchling production starts
# December 20 and ends April 30 each season.  Observed counts are 
# limited so they are used to determine amplitude of each season
# and for each sector.  Amplitudes for sectors are correlated.

# Using the second order polynomial with conditions that y = 0 at t = 0 and 132,
# we can solve that y = a + bx + bx^2, where a = 0 and b = -132c.
