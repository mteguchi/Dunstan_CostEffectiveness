To determine the effects of reprofiling the nesting beach at Raine Island on hatchling production, we compared the estimated numbers of hatchlings between modified and control sections. First, we compare the observed numbers of hatchlings per 100 m of beach between modified and controlled sections. Second, we estimate the annual total hatchling production per section by fitting a statistical model to hatchling counts. The estimated total annual production was compared between modified and contorl sections.

# Modified Richards equation by Girondot et al. (2007) {-}

In a separate analysis, I fitted various functions to hatchling counts and found that using a modified Richards function (Girondot et al. 2007) provided the most precise estimates. Results of the comparison of these models are available upon request. The modified Richards function in Girondot et al. (2007) is composed of two symmetrical functions that are connected at the peak of nesting.  

The function has the following form:

$M_1 = (1 + (2 * exp(K) - 1) * exp((1/(-S)) * (P - d))) ^ {(-1/exp(K))}$

$M_2 = (1 + (2 * exp(K) - 1) * exp((1/S) * (P - d))) ^ {(-1/exp(K))}$

$N = min_N + (max_N - min_N) * (M_1 * M_2)$, where

$d$ is the number of days from the beginning of nesting season,

$S$ defines the "fatness" of the function ($S > 0$),

$K > 0$ defines the "flatness" at the peak of the function ($K > 0$),

$P$ defines where the peak is relatvie to the range of $d$, where $min(d) < P < max(d)$,

$min_N$ is "the basal level of nesting outside the nesting season" and,

$max_N >> min_N$

This model was fitted to observed hatchling counts per 100 m in each sector and parameters and their uncertainties were estimated. The effects of reprofiling of experimental sectors were determeind by the ratio of estimated hatching production per 100 m between reprofiled (2014R and 2017R) and control (South) sections.

Although no formal model fitting test was conducted, qualitatiely, the functions fit reasonable to the data (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fit)). The fitted function, then, was used for each season to estimate the hatchling production per 100 m. Because the parameters of the function were shared among sectors, estimates were available even when there were limited data.

# Effects of reprofiling {-}

To determine the effects of reprofiling the beach, the number of estimated hatchlings per 100 m was compared between 2014R and the South sector and between 2017R and the South sector. The reprofiled areas (2014R and 2017R) experience the same environmental effects and nesting activities as the South sector.

The reprofiled sectors consistently produced more hatchlings than the unmodified South sector over the seven year period except one year (Table \@ref(tab:Table-increase-2014R)). The increase in hatchling productions in the 2014R sector ranged from ```r format(signif(min(median.2014R.South$ratio), digits = 3), nsmall = 2)``` in ```r median.2014R.South[median.2014R.South$ratio == min(median.2014R.South$ratio),"Season"]``` to ```r format(signif(max(median.2014R.South$ratio), digits = 3), nsmall = 2)``` in ```r median.2014R.South[median.2014R.South$ratio == max(median.2014R.South$ratio), "Season"]```.  For the 2017R sector, the hatchling production per 100 m was ```r format(signif(max(increase.2017R), digits = 3), nsmall = 2)``` times greater than that from the South sector.
