To determine the effects of reprofiling the nesting beach at Raine Island on hatchling production, we compared the numbers of hatchlings between modified and control sections. We analyzed these data in two different approaches. First, we compared the observed numbers of hatchlings per 100 m of beach between modified and controlled sections. A hierarchical Bayesian model was developed to compare the mean hatchling counts per 100 m between the modified and control sectors. Second, we developed statistical models to estimate the annual hatchling production per 100 m per sector. The estimated total annual production per sector then was compared between modified and control sectors. 

# Observed hatchling count comparison {-}

Raw hatching counts per 100 m transects were compared between the 2014R and South sectors and between the 2017R and South sectors. These comparisons indicated that the modified sectors (2014R and 2017R) produced more hatchlings than the control sector (South) in all but one year (2019; Figure \@ref(fig:plot-obs-comparison)). 

```{r raw-comparison, include=F, echo=F}
data.3 %>% filter(Sector == "2014R"  |
                    Sector == "2017R" |
                    Sector == "South" ) %>%
  transmute(Date = Date, 
            Sector = as.factor(Sector),
            Season = as.factor(Season),
            Counts = Counts_100m) -> data.3.reprofile

data.3 %>% filter(Sector == "2014R"  | 
                    Sector == "South")   -> data.3.2014R
  # group_by(Season) %>% 
  # summarize(Counts = sum(Counts_100m, na.rm = T))  -> data.3.2014R

   stat_boxplot(aes(x = Season, y = Counts, color = Sector))
  #facet_grid(~ Sector)

if (save.fig)
  ggsave(plot = p.obs,
         filename = "figures/reprofile_comparison.png",
         device = "png", dpi = 600)


```

```{r plot-obs-comparison, echo=F, cache=T, fig.cap = "Observed hatchling counts at three comparable sectors. 2014R was modified in 2014, whereas 2017R was modified in 2017.

```

Because of unequal variances among seasons and sectors, simple linear models were inappropriate for these data. The base-10 logarithmic transformation alleviated the problem somewhat (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-log-obs-comparison)) but not sufficient to satisfy the equal-variance assumption of ANOVA. 


```{r log-comparison, echo=F, include=F}

```

```{r linear-models, include=F, echo=F}
# ANOVA comparisons
lm.2014R <- lm(log10(Counts_100m) ~ Sector * Season,
               data = data.3.2014R)

lm.2017R <- lm(log10(Counts_100m) ~ Sector * Season,
               data = data.3.2017R)
#summary(lm.2014R)

#summary(lm.2017R)
```

To circumvent the unequal variance problem, we created a Bayesian model to explicitly incorporate the unequal variances and compared the means between modified and control sectors. The model has the following form.

$log(y_{i,y,s}) \sim N(\mu_{y,s}, \sigma_{y,s})$,

where $i$ is the index for samples within year $y$ ($i = 1, ..., n_{y,s}$). Prior distributions were 

$\mu_{y,s} \sim N(0, 3)$ and 

$\sigma_{y,s} \sim GAM(0.1,0.1)$). 

We then determined the differences in the means:

$\Delta \mu_{2014R} = exp(\mu_{y, 2014R}) - exp(\mu_{y, South})$ and

$\Delta \mu_{2017R} = exp(\mu_{y, 2017R}) - exp(\mu_{y, South})$.

The proportion of $\Delta \mu_{y,s} > 0$ can be considered as the probability that the modified sector produced greater number of hatchlings than the control sector. 

The analysis was conducted using JAGS in R via jagsUI package. It can be found in "reprofile_comparison.Rmd" and results were saved in "Reprofile_comparison.rds." Convergence of MCMC was reached for all parameters (Rhat < 1.1). R and JAGS code are included in the supplementary material. 

```{r Bayesian_comparison, include=F, echo=F}
jm <- readRDS(file = "RData/Reprofile_comparison.rds")

jm$summary %>% data.frame() %>% 
  rownames_to_column(var = "Parameter")  -> summary.df

delta.mu.2014 <- summary.df[grep("deltaMu2014", summary.df$Parameter),]

delta.mu.2014 %>% 
  transmute(Year = seq(2014, 2020),
            Mean = mean,
            Low = X2.5.,
            High = X97.5.,
            f = f) -> delta.mu.2014.df

delta.mu.2017 <- summary.df[grep("deltaMu2017", summary.df$Parameter),]

delta.mu.2017 %>%

            Mean = mean,

            High = X97.5.,
            f = f)  -> delta.mu.2017.df

```

For the 2014R sector, hatchling production was greater than the control (South) sector with high confidence (probability > 0.78) for all years except 2019, when the production in 2014R was less than the control sector (probability = 0.85, \@ref(tab:Table-raw-2014R)). 


```{r Table-raw-2014R, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```

Similar results were found for the 2017R sector, where hatchling production was greater than the control (South) sector with high confidence (probability > 0.65) for all years except 2019, when the production in 2014R was less than the control sector (probability = 0.87, Table \@ref(tab:Table-raw-2017R)).

# Comparison of estimated season-wide hatchling production {-}

In this analysis, I fitted various functions to hatchling counts to estimate the season-wide hatchling production. A modified Richards function (Girondot et al. 2007) provided the most precise estimates. Results of the comparison of these models are available upon request ("hatchling_counts_modeling_2021-05.Rmd").

The modified Richards function in Girondot et al. (2007) is composed of two symmetrical functions that are connected at the peak of nesting.  

The function has the following form:

$M_1 = (1 + (2 * exp(K) - 1) * exp((1/(-S)) * (P - d))) ^ {(-1/exp(K))}$

$M_2 = (1 + (2 * exp(K) - 1) * exp((1/S) * (P - d))) ^ {(-1/exp(K))}$

$N = min_N + (max_N - min_N) * (M_1 * M_2)$, where

$d$ is the number of days from the beginning of nesting season,

$S$ defines the "fatness" of the function ($S > 0$),

$K > 0$ defines the "flatness" at the peak of the function ($K > 0$),

$P$ defines where the peak is relatvie to the range of $d$, where $min(d) < P < max(d)$,

$min_N$ is "the basal level of nesting outside the nesting season" and,

$max_N >> min_N$

This model was fitted to observed annual hatchling counts per 100 m in each sector and parameters and their uncertainties were estimated. The effects of reprofiling of experimental sectors were determined by the ratio of estimated annual hatching production per 100 m between modified (2014R and 2017R) and control (South) sections.

Although no formal model fitting test was conducted, qualitatively, the functions fit reasonable to the data (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fit)). The fitted function, then, was used for each season to estimate the hatchling production per 100 m. Because the parameters of the function were shared among sectors, estimates were available even when there were limited data.

The reprofiled sectors consistently produced more hatchlings than the unmodified South sector over the seven year period except one year (Table \@ref(tab:Table-increase-2014R)). The increase in hatchling productions in the 2014R sector ranged from ```r format(signif(min(median.2014R.South$ratio), digits = 3), nsmall = 2)``` in ```r median.2014R.South[median.2014R.South$ratio == min(median.2014R.South$ratio),"Season"]``` to ```r format(signif(max(median.2014R.South$ratio), digits = 3), nsmall = 2)``` in ```r median.2014R.South[median.2014R.South$ratio == max(median.2014R.South$ratio), "Season"]```.  For the 2017R sector, the increase in hatchling production per 100 m ranged from ```r format(signif(min(median.2017R.South$ratio), digits = 3), nsmall = 2)``` in ```r median.2017R.South[median.2017R.South$ratio == min(median.2017R.South$ratio),"Season"]``` to ```r format(signif(max(median.2017R.South$ratio), digits = 3), nsmall = 2)``` in ```r median.2017R.South[median.2017R.South$ratio == max(median.2017R.South$ratio), "Season"]``` (Table \@ref(tab:Table-increase-2017R).
