In this document, I describe the steps I used to estimate the number of annual hatchling production from several observations during each nesting season at four sections of Raine Island.  In a separate analysis, I fitted various functions to hatchling counts and found that using modified Richards functions (Girondot et al. 2007) provided the most precise estimates.  Results of the comparison of these models are available upon request.  

# Modified Richards equation by Girondot et al. (2007)

In this approach, I used the model described by Girondot et al. (2007). It has two symmetrical functions that are connected at the peak of nesting.  

The function has the following form:

M1 = (1 + (2 * exp(K) - 1) * exp((1/(-S)) * (P - d))) ^ (-1/exp(K))

M2 = (1 + (2 * exp(K) - 1) * exp((1/S) * (P - d))) ^ (-1/exp(K))

N = min_N + (max_N - min_N) * (M1 * M2), where

d is the number of days from the beginning of nesting season,

S defines the "fatness" of the function (S > 0),

K > 0 defines the "flatness" at the peak of the function (K > 0),

P defines where the peak is relatvie to the range of d, where min(d) < P < max(d),

min_N is "the basal level of nesting outside the nesting season" and,

max_N >> min_N

This model was fitted to observed hatchling counts per 100 m in each sector and estimated parameters and their uncertainties were used to compute the total number of hatchlings and its uncertainties from each sector.

Fitted functions to the data are shown in Figure 1.  Although no formal model fitting test was conducted, qualitatiely, the functions fit reasonable to the data (Figure 11).  The fitted function, then, was used for each season to estimate the hatchling counts per 100 m.  Because the parameters of the function were shared among sectors, estimates were available even when there were limited data.

## Effects of reprofiling
To determine the effects of reprofiling the beach, the number of estimated hatchlings per 100 m was compared between 2014R and the South sector and between 2017R and the South sector.  The reprofiled areas (2014 and 2017) experience the same environmental effects and nesting activities as the South sector.

The reprofiled sectors consistently produced more hatchlings than the unmodified South sector over the seven year period except one year(Table \@ref(tab:Table.increase.2014R)). The increase in hatchling productions in the 2014R sector ranged from ```r format(signif(min(median.2014R.South$ratio), digits = 3), nsmall = 2)``` in ```r median.2014R.South[median.2014R.South$ratio == min(median.2014R.South$ratio),"Season"]``` to ```r format(signif(max(median.2014R.South$ratio), digits = 3), nsmall = 2)``` in ```r median.2014R.South[median.2014R.South$ratio == max(median.2014R.South$ratio), "Season"]```.  For the 2017R sector, the hatchling production per 100 m was ```r format(signif(max(increase.2017R), digits = 3), nsmall = 2)``` times greater than that from the South sector.  


```{r Table.increase.2014R, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::kable(median.2014R.South, 
             digits = 2,
             format.args = list(big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE),
             caption = "Amount of increase in hatchling productions at the 2014R sector compared with the South sector.")
```
